# TraizelCraft Official Website

## Description

_Duration: 2 Weeks_

This is the official GitHub repo for the TraizelCraft Website. The TraizelCraft Website is a centerpiece for TraizelCraft Network, where the community can come together to
talk, share, and have fun! There are several pages:

- Home
- Events
- News
- FAQ
- Wiki
- Forums
- Downloads
- Extras

The Home page is the main page users go to when navigating to the url. It will contain the main info, as well as some videos and links to social medias.
The Events page is a way to let Traizel and any Collaborators setup events for the community to participate in. Users may view and sign up for any event.
The News page is managed by Traizel and his Moderators/Admins. Users can view any up to date articles that are posted here.
The Forums is a nice way to talk with others in the community. The threaded setup makes it easy to navigate the forums, and talk with others about certain topics.
The FAQ, Wiki, and Downloads pages are purely for information. The Downloads page contains all of the downloads for TraizelCraft and any Addons by Traizel. Users must have an account to access this page.
Extra pages, like the login/registration or the add events/add article pages are soley situational pages that will be accessible when needed.
